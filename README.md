Serial Number Automation Tool

This project is a desktop application built with Python that automates serial number management and firmware updates for electronic devices. It combines a simple user interface with automated device communication and web-based configuration to streamline repetitive tasks.

Key Features:
Connects to devices via serial (COM) ports
Uploads bootloader and firmware files automatically
Updates and verifies device serial numbers through a web interface
Provides real-time status indicators for each device
Supports multiple devices in a single batch
Simple, intuitive GUI built with PyQt6

Purpose:
To save time and reduce errors in managing device serial numbers and performing firmware updates by automating manual processes.


Setup Instructions:
Install Python and create a virtual environment.
Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
Use a standalone Chrome for testing (chrome-for-test.exe) with its matching ChromeDriver, and update the code paths accordingly—no driver updates are needed.
Run the GUI application by executing gui_10_colorbutton.py.
